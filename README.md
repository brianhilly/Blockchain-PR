Blockchain PR checklist - Info for your next campaign 
**Blockchain PR Checklist**
===========================

In the blockchain world there are so many different things your company should do. Running a successful campaign is hard, but by following certain guidelines you can increase your chances of running a great [blockchain PR](https://guerrillabuzz.com/blockchain-pr/) campaign.

The cost of each campaign might differ but these points should be applied to each campaign no matter how small or large it is.

Before launching any Blockchain PR campaigns make sure you read a few guides that can point you in the right direction.

**In this article I will share with you the Blockchain PR checklist:**

-   **Summary:** Explaining what you your company does and its pros and cons in a few bullet  points is a very important part of your blockchain PR campaign.

-   Write it in a document so you can share it with your marketing team or blockchain marketing agency. It might sound obvious, but without being able to explain what you do in simple words, your target audience is less likely to understand what your company does when they will see you mentioned on different news sites.

-   **Find the opportunity:** After understanding your company's pros and cons, do some market research and find non-blockchain competitors.

-   Then make a succinct summary of how your company can improve this ecosystem and how the target audience will benefit from your product.

-   After having all this information, you will be able to come up with a few creative ideas for mentioning your company's product. If you can't come up with anything, use a [marketing agency](https://guerrillabuzz.com/). 

-   **First Impression:** Don't start your PR campaign before you have a great-looking site, active social media channels, readable [white paper](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whitepaper.asp), explanatory video, few blog articles, and a telegram group. Without this stuff the money in your blockchain PR campaign might be spent for nothing.

-   Security: Make sure your site is using [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and has good [security](https://www.hostgator.com/blog/how-secure-is-your-website-free-website-security-checklist/). Some of your potential investors will check this out. 

-   **Transparency**: Don't try to buy fake followers on Twitter and fake Telegram community members.

-   It gives you no benefits at all and once you have 40,000 followers but only 2 likes on your tweet, people will assume you just bought your community. This will make you lose credibility.

-   SEO: Make sure that not every article in your blockchain PR campaign links only to your homepage.

-   Write great blog posts that follow good SEO standards and make them stronger by linking to them in your campaign too. 

-   Distribution: Promoting your articles in different communities increases the views the articles receive and the chances that your target audience will see and learn about your company.

-   Make sure you share your articles on various social media channels and websites, including Reddit, Steemit, Bitcointalk, Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook.

-   [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), [Steemit](https://steemit.com/) and [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/) hate marketers, so instead of trying to  'sell' your article or the product to the community, find a better, more creative way to do it.
